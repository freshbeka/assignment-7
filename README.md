# Brief review of the Rpackage `magick`

### Package title
magick

### Location
CRAN: `install.packages("magick")` also on GitHub (for development): https://github.com/ropensci/magick

### Vignette(s)
The package has a vigniette that quickly, intuitively, and with a bit of humor, demostrates the basic functionality of the package. 

### Application(s)
Images of all types can be easily cropped, combined, and edited within R. Can also be used to construct and deconstruct gifs.

### Review
I discovered `magick` when I was unable to use another favorite package (`patchwork`) to compile a multi-panel plot. In mycase, `patchwork` was unable to ternary diagrams produced from the package ggtern because the usual x-y dimentions of the image objects are lost. I've used `magick` to attach a legend in the exact spot I wanted it a three panel plot that shared a legend. 

Write a short (<300 words) review of the package. What is the primary purpose of the package (eg, is used for plotting, reading or scraping data, manipulating data, statistical modeling, etc)? What are the things you like about the package? Are there things you donâ€™t like or wish it did differently? Was the package easy to learn how to use? Would you recommend this package to someone else?
